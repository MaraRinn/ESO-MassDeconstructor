# ESO Mass Deconstructor (Revived)

Mass Deconstructor is a deconstructing & refining tool to help you clear your bank and inventory of all that junk you collect during questing, dungeons and trials.

Use the AddOn Settings to configure the types of items to automatically deconstruct. Please be careful about allowing Mass Deconstructor to deconstruct "set items" with high quality.

# History

Originally written by ahmetertem as [Mass Deconstructor](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1118-MassDeconstructor.html), it stopped working with the Morrowind release.

MaralieRindu has joined the development team and is continuing maintenance. This release marks restoration of the basic functionality, with mass refining of raw materials coming soon. Follow along at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MaraRinn/ESO-MassDeconstructor) for issues and development.
