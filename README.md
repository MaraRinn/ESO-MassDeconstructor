# ESO Mass Deconstructor (Revived)

Mass Deconstructor is a deconstructing & refining tool to help you clear your bank and inventory of all that junk you collect during questing, dungeons and trials.

Use the AddOn Settings to configure the types of items to automatically deconstruct. Please be careful about allowing Mass Deconstructor to deconstruct "set items" with high quality.

**This addon is not functional, I'm still learning how to write ESO AddOns**
