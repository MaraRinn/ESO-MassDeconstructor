# ESO Mass Deconstructor (Revived)

Mass Deconstructor is a deconstructing & refining tool to help you clear your bank and inventory of all that junk you collect during questing, dungeons and trials.

Use the AddOn Settings to configure the types of items to automatically deconstruct. Please be careful about allowing Mass Deconstructor to deconstruct "set items" with high quality.

**This addon is not functional, I'm still learning how to write ESO AddOns**

# History

Originally written by ahmetertem as [Mass Deconstructor](http://www.esoui.com/downloads/info1118-MassDeconstructor.html), it stopped working with the Morrowind release.

MaralieRindu has taken up maintenance of the package under the name "Mass Deconstructor (Revived)". This release marks restoration of the basic functionality, with mass refining of raw materials coming soon. Follow along at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MaraRinn/ESO-MassDeconstructor) for issues and development.
